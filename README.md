# winflashdilated-former
A robust and efficient multihorizon photovoltaic power prediction with dilated Transformer
This is a model structure designed for clean energy - photovoltaic power generation. Considering the large volatility of data and the high update frequency, a model suitable for multi-time domain prediction is designed, hoping to provide a more powerful tool for scheduling photovoltaic power.
